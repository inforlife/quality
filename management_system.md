Software Management System (SMS) shall encompass all of the activities that affect the software provided by the Software Development Team at InfoRLife and, at least it must document the following aspects:

- Software Life Cycle:
  - Requirements Gathering and Management;
  - Features Traceability from Requirement to Production Code;
  - Development Process;
  - Deployment Procedure;
  - Monitoring Activities.
- Coding Standard.
- Testing Strategy.
- Validation Procedure.

As stated in the Quality Policy, the Software Development Team at InfoRLife considers continuous improvement a key factor in providing superior quality software. Because of that, the documents that describe SMS as regularly updated to reflect the changes in the development process.

Keeping SMS documents on GitHub (and not on paper SOPs) allows the development team to maintain documentation and process always in sync. At the same time, the documentation is treated like all the other artifacts the team stores on GitHub with the advantage of clear content review and revision information.


### Software Life Cycle
The up-to-date life cycle adopted by InfoRLife SA in developing software applications is described in the ["Process" documentation site](https://inforlife.github.io/process/).

### Coding Standard
The up-to-date standard adopted by InfoRLife SA in developing software applications is described [as "Dot Files"](https://github.com/inforlife/dotfiles)


### Testing Strategy
The up-to-date testing strategy adopted by InfoRLife SA in developing software applications is described in the ["Test-Driven Development" section](https://inforlife.github.io/process/test-driven-development.html) of the ["Process" documentation site](https://inforlife.github.io/process/).

### Validation Procedure
<div class="alert warning">To be formalized. See IT1221.</div>

## Management
The Managing Director, the QA department, the Software Development Team, and the employees ensure the SMS is effective at achieving software quality and exceeding user expectations.

The development Team Leader ensures [quality objectives](https://inforlife.github.io/quality/objectives.html) are **established**, **measured**, **reported**, and **periodically reviewed** to ensure both quality and process effectiveness.

Each quarter, The Development Team collect and analyze the predefined [quality objectives](https://inforlife.github.io/quality/objectives.html) and report the analysis at the Quarterly Management Review (QMR).   

It is through the QMR and other such reviews that the Software Development Team at InfoRLife is able to continuously improve software, processes, and quality management methods that demonstrate the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

User feedback is another method of measuring SMSâ€™s success and attaining Continuous Improvement. Because of that the Software Development Team at InfoRLife encourages all users of its applications to provide as much feedback as possible.

## Organization
Because the development of skilled personnel contributes to the production of high-quality software, investing in personnel and emphasizing training and self-improvement are testaments to the commitment to quality the Software Development Team at InfoRLife has taken.
